DriveBoardApp Frontend
======================

DriveboardApp consists of three pieces of software. The *fontend* connects to the [backend](backend.md) for functionality which in turn communicates with the [firmware](firmware.md). It provides a browser-based graphical user interface. The typical setup is to run the *backend* on the CNC machine and pull up the GUI on a laptop or tablet. This way users of the machine do not have to install drivers or applications.
